# This is an Underwater ROV project

We want to build an underwater ROV. The features and objectives of this ROV are

- Simple to build using easily available comodity components.
- Fail safe so that in case of failure ROV is positively boyant
- Umbilical to surface only carries data no power.


## Motors

The motors will be outrunners. We choose this as there are not brushes that will corrode.

## Microcontroler

Currently we plan to use an Arduino. But might have to upgrade to something more powerful to handle video.

## Communication with surface.

Two wire and serial communication to the Arduino is what we were planning currently.
